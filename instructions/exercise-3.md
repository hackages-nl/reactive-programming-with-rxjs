## Challenge 2: Build your own version of the `interval` Operator

In this challenge you will implement your own version of the `interval Operator`:
- The implementation should be done in the [src/lib/interval.ts](../src/lib/interval.ts) file.
- The tests are located next to it in the [src/lib/interval.spec.ts](../src/lib/interval.spec.ts) file. 

Do not forget to run the tests with `pnpm test --watch` or `npm test  -- --watch`. 

At the end of this exercise, the following points should be met:
- [ ] All tests should be green
- [ ] The function `interval` should be implemented
