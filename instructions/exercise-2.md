## Challenge: Build your own version of the `fromEvent` from scratch 

In this challenge you will implement your own version of `fromEvent`:
- Implement the function `fromEvent` by following the hints provided by your tests (`npm test -- --watch`)
- The implementation should be done in the [src/lib/fromEvent.ts](../lib/fromEvent.ts) file.
- The tests are located next to it in the [src/lib/fromEvent.spec.ts](../lib/fromEvent.spec.ts) file. 

**Hint: You'll need the `Observable` function implemented in the previous exercise.**

Do not forget to run the tests with `pnpm test --watch` or `npm test  -- --watch`. 

At the end of this exercise, the following points should be met:
- [ ] All tests should be green
- [ ] The function `fromEvent` should be implemented
