## Challenge: Build your own version of the `mapTo` operator

This part of the challenge will deal with more operators. 

In this challenge you will implement your own version of the `mapTo operator`:
- The implementation should be done in the [src/lib/mapTo.ts](../src/lib/mapTo.ts) file.
- The tests are located next to it in the [src/lib/mapTo.spec.ts](../src/lib/mapTo.spec.ts) file. 

Do not forget to run the tests with `pnpm test --watch` or `npm test  -- --watch` . 

At the end of this exercise, the following points should be met:
- [ ] All tests should be green
- [ ] The function `mapTo` should be implemented
