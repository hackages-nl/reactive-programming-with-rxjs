# Build a timer application with TypeScript while rebuilding your own RxJS

Do not forget to read the [readme](../README.md) 

## How to get started

- Launch the app `pnpm start` or `npm start` and go to http://localhost:8000/
- Run the tests ! `pnpm test` or `npm test`
- Alternatively, run the tests in watch mode `pnpm test --watch` or `npm test  -- --watch` then press `a` to run all tests.
- Once your work is done **commit** and **push** `git add src && git commit -m "What did you do?" && git push origin`

Hint: Your application might not run. It probably contains some bugs. You are here to solve them. ;-)

## Challenge: Build your own version of the `RxJS` function

In this challenge you will implement your own version of the famous `RxJS`:

At the end of this Jam, the following points should be met:
- [ ] All tests should be green
- [ ] The function `Observable` should be implemented
- [ ] The function `fromEvent` should be implemented
- [ ] The function `interval` should be implemented
- [ ] The function `of` should be implemented
- [ ] The function `mapTo` should be implemented
- [ ] The function `merge` should be implemented
- [ ] The function `switchTo` should be implemented
